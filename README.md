# Introduction

An application for adding friends and poking them 👉🏽

# Instant Friends (Fullstack Web App)

🖍 User can sign up for a new account, or log in to an existing account 
<br>
🔢 User can see how many friends they currently have <br>
<br>
➕ User can add friends through an input, which can then be removed from their profile if needed <br>
<br>
💎 taking nods from glassmorphism and neomorphism design styles, we created a clean, modernized interface that is easy and enjoyable for any user’s experience <br>
